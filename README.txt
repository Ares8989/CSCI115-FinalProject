This is a video game review website, created for the purposes of a Computer Science 115 course at Vancouver Island University.

Interesting Features:
-   The "Top Game Reviews" element uses the browser's local storage to hold a JavaScript array. 
    When a user visits one of the reviews on the site, it is added to the array. When a user,
    rates one of the reviews it's popularity is increased/decreased. The top 5 reviews are displayed.
-   Each of the review pages have their titles set by JavaScript.
-   The search bar searches google directly.
-   The sign-up form doesnt currently do anything, since we didn't learn any PHP.
-   The navigation bar is dynamic. If the screen/window size is small the search bar disappears. 
    If the screen/window size is extremely small the nav bar disappears completely.
